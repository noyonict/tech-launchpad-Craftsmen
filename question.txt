Question
Introduction to Python:
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console?

Python Basics – Variables:
Create a program that prompts the user for their name and age, then stores these in variables and prints a message saying, "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."

Conditions – If, Else, Elif:
Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether the number is even or odd.

Conditions – Example:
Expand the above program. If the number is divisible by both 2 and 5, print "This number is divisible by 2 and 5."

Condition & Loop – Basics:
Create a program that uses a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10. For each number, if it's even, print "[number] is even". If it's odd, print "[number] is odd".

For Loop and Condition:
Write a program that uses a for loop to print all the prime numbers between 2 and 50.

While Loop & Condition:
Implement a program where the user is repeatedly asked to enter numbers until they type 'stop'. Once they do, the program should display the sum of all the numbers entered.

Functions:
Define a function called multiply. This function should take two parameters and return their product. Test your function with several pairs of numbers to ensure it works correctly.

Loop & Condition Combined:
Write a function called count_even_numbers that takes a list of numbers and returns the count of even numbers in the list. For example, for the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the function should return 2.

Final Challenge – Comprehensive:
Create a program that does the following:
Defines a function is_prime which checks if a number is prime.
Prompts the user to enter a range (two numbers).
Uses a loop to go through the numbers in the given range.
Prints out all prime numbers in that range.
